### FULL-STACK DEVELOPER


## Who am I
I am a passionate professional with a keen interest in new technologies. I embarked on my career back in 2008 as a Junior Developer, primarily focusing on web page development. It was during this time that I discovered my love for stylesheets and started working with PHP, JavaScript, and jQuery. Since then, I have continued to expand my knowledge in various technologies and have had the privilege of collaborating with diverse development teams, which has been immensely fulfilling.

I am an extremely proactive individual who thrives in multidisciplinary team environments, aiming to deliver exceptional results. I am excited about taking on new challenges and continuously learning to foster professional growth.
